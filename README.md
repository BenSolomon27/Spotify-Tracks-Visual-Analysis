# Spotify-Tracks-Visual-Analysis

## Background
I decided to create this Dash app after working on a project at my university that first introduced me to working with [Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/). Rather than housing my insights within Jupyter Lab as I had initially done, I wanted to challenge myself to display these visuals in a cleaner way, and thus I began working with [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/). Thanks to the help of one of my professors, I am now aware that I can publicly share this app on [Render](https://render.com/). You can view the app [here](https://spotify-tracks-visual-analysis.onrender.com/) or in the About section of the repo. 

As far as the substance of the project goes, the dataset I am using is called the [Spotify Tracks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset/data). It covers songs on Spotify over a range of 125 genres, and each track has a wide range of features ranging from clearer-cut attributes like popularity all the way to more esoteric measures such as acousticness. 

My goal with this project is to shed some light on some interesting relationships I found within the data that stem from my curiosity as a musician and someone very interested in the music industry. I hope you find something interesting out of my analysis!
